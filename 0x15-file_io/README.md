File I/O Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. It aims to learn about how to handle files (open, close, read and write), file descriptors, system calls and file permissions in C language.

Files All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
|  [0-read_textfile.c]() | A function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output |
| [1-create_file.c]() | A function that creates a file |
| [2-append_text_to_file.c]() |  A function that appends text at the end of a file |
| [3-cp.c]() | A function that copies the content of a file to another file | 
| [100-elf_header.c]() | A function that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file |
